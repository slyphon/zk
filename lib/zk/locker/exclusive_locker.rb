    # An exclusive lock implementation
    #
    # If the name 'dingus' is given, then in the case of an exclusive lock, the
    # algorithm works like:
    #
    # * lock_path = `zk.create("/_zklocking/dingus/ex", :sequential => true, :ephemeral => true)`
    # * extract the digit from the lock path
    # * of all the children under '/_zklocking/dingus', do we have the lowest digit?
    #   * __yes__: then we hold the lock, if we're non-blocking, return true
    #   * __no__: is the lock blocking?
    #       * __yes__: then set a watch on the next-to-lowest node and sleep the current thread until that node has been deleted
    #       * __no__: return false, you lose
    #
